# Script Explanations - Exploratory Data Analysis


The "plot1.R", "plot2.R", "plot3.R", and "plot4.R" scripts are designed to create four PNG plots based on a dataset called "household_power_consumption.txt".  This dataset is available compressed in zip format in this repository as "exdata-data-household_power_consumption.zip".  Alternatively, the dataset can be downloaded [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip), also in zip format.  Uncompressed, the dataset is 133MB.  This dataset is from the “Individual household electric power consumption Data Set” from the [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/).


## Running the Script


* The dataset must be uncompressed and named "household_power_consumption.txt"
* The dataset and R scripts must be in the same current working directory


## Expected Outputs


* Four plots in PNG format are outputted
* Graphs will not be displayed on the screen by default
